# ðŸš€ Happy to Kickstart My Java Developer Internship at Soft Nexis Technology

Excited to begin my internship journey as a **Java Developer** at **Soft Nexis Technology**!  
This repository contains my first assignment, which includes:

âœ… Setting up the Java development environment  
âœ… Writing and executing 10 Java programs that cover basic concepts such as:
- Variables and Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Loops (for, while)
- Arrays
- Methods
- Switch Cases
- Basic Math and Logic

Each program was written and run in **Visual Studio Code**, and a **screen recording** is included demonstrating all executions.
